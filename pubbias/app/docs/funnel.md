#### Significance funnel plot

The estimate among only nonaffirmative studies (gray diamond) represents a corrected estimate under worst-case publication bias that favors affirmative results. If the gray diamond represents a negligible effect size or if it is much smaller than the pooled estimate among all studies (black diamond), this suggests that the meta-analysis may not be robust to extreme publication bias.
