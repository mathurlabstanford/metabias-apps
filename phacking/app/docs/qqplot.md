#### Diagnostic quantile-quantile plot

To assess the fit of right-truncated meta-analysis and possible violations of its distributional assumptions, we can plot the fitted cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the published nonaffirmative estimates versus their empirical CDF. If the points do not adhere fairly closely to a 45-degree line, the right-truncated meta-analysis may not fit adequately.
